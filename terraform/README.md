# Terraform Notes

## Important command
- `terraform fmt`, it is to rewrite terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.
- `terraform init`, like as you would suggest it is to initialize (or reinitialize) a terraform project with `main.tf` file.
- `terraform plan`, creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that *Terraform plans* to make to your infrastructure.
